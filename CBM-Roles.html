						<td><img src="ROLE-DIRECT-DPS.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE SUSTAIN" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Direct DPS is the category for classes that can keep a constant stream of damage without too much oversight. They generally are always ready for combat and can outdamage most of their enemies through smart use of their tools.</td>

						<td><img src="ROLE-INDIRECT-DPS.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE UTILITY" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Indirect DPS is the category for classes that will mostly excel if they can properly build up their advantage. They depend mostly on finding or creating situations where they will have the upper hand and cause a lot of damage with that.</td>

					<tr>
						<td><img src="ROLE-SUPPORT.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE ROLE" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Support is the category for classes that can benefit allies in amazing ways. They aren't that powerful if alone, but can literally change the tide of most battles if they can use their skills on team games.</td>

						<td><img src="ROLE-OFFTANK.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE SUSTAIN" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Off-Tank is the category for classes that can take on direct combat constantly. A combination of sustain and damage makes those classes most likely to survive a direct combat, and they are great at harassing enemies.</td>

						<td><img src="ROLE-PROTECTOR.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE UTILITY" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Protector is the category for classes that have special defensive moves to benefits from enemies wasting attacks on them. They generally have either high Health stats and/or can render enemy attacks useless with their specialized kits.</td>

						<td><img src="ROLE-TANK.png" class="imgRole" alt="DAMAGE UTILITY" width="100" align="middle"></td>
						<td style="color:#eeeeee">Tank is the category for classes that are extremely good at staying alive. They have the highest Health stats on the game, and are competent enought at fighting, but they will mostly be kind the of character that will either take full atention to kill or team work to deal with them rapidly.</td>
